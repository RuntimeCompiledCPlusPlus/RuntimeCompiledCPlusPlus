Runtime-Compiled C++ is a way to reliably make major changes to your C++ code at runtime and see the results immediately. It's aimed at games development but could be useful in any industry where turnaround times are a bottleneck.

Supported OS / Compilers:

* Windows XP+, Visual Studio 2008+. Note we currently distribute only the VS 2010 solution and projects.
* Mac OS X 10.7+ with XCode 4.
* Linux using Eclipse CDT (tested Ubuntu 12.04).

For Visual Studio and XCode the main project file is found in the Aurora directory. For Eclipse use File->Import->General->Existing Projects into Workspace and select the RuntimeCompiledCPlusPlus directory and import all projects it finds.
