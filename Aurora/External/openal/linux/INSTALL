If this is your first time retrieving CVS, you will need to build the
configure script and config.h.in dependency.  Just run

	sh ./autogen.sh

and you should be okay.

Compilation / installation goes something like this:

	./configure --enable-prefix=/usr/local
	make
	cd test
	[run tests]
	make install

configure options:
	--enable-debug        Enable debugging info.
	--enable-optimization Enables optimization.

etc...  Use --help to determine the rest.  Most people will be fine with
--enable-optimization.  I don't recommend --enable-jlib.  It's only
useful to me.  Really.

Debugging options are now in the form:

	--enable-debug-blah

in general, this will give you too much information to be useful on a
particular topic.  Use --enable-debug-maximus to get all debugging
messages possible.

If this is your first time installing openal, you'll probably need to
run ldconfig.

ATTENTION:

The following changes have taken place that may alter the manner in 
which an installation works on your machine.  Please be advised:

	- SDL is no longer required to build --- the conversion code
	  has been copied into the audioconvert directory.

If you experience any problems building or with the test code, please
email me: tsaotsao@lokigames.com.  Thanks.

jv.
