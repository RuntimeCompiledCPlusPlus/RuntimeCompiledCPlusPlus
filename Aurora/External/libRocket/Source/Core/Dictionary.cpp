/*
 There are three kinds of slots in the table:
 
 1. Unused.  me_key == me_value == NULL
 Does not hold an active (key, value) pair now and never did.  Unused can
 transition to Active upon key insertion.  This is the only case in which
 me_key is NULL, and is each slot's initial state.
 
 2. Active.  me_key != NULL and me_key != dummy and me_value != NULL
 Holds an active (key, value) pair.  Active can transition to Dummy upon
 key deletion.  This is the only case in which me_value != NULL.
 
 3. Dummy.  me_key == dummy and me_value == NULL
 Previously held an active (key, value) pair, but that was deleted and an
 active pair has not yet overwritten the slot.  Dummy can transition to
 Active upon key insertion.  Dummy slots cannot be made Unused again
 (cannot have me_key set to NULL), else the probe sequence in case of
 collision would have no way to know they were once active.
 
 Note: .popitem() abuses the me_hash field of an Unused or Dummy slot to
 hold a search finger.  The me_hash field of Unused or Dummy slots has no
 meaning otherwise.
 
 
 To ensure the lookup algorithm terminates, there must be at least one Unused
 slot (NULL key) in the table.
 The value ma_fill is the number of non-NULL keys (sum of Active and Dummy);
 ma_used is the number of non-NULL, non-dummy keys (== the number of non-NULL
													 values == the number of Active items).
 To avoid slowing down lookups on a near-full table, we resize the table when
 it's two-thirds full.

 Major subtleties ahead:  Most hash schemes depend on having a "good" hash
 function, in the sense of simulating randomness.  Python doesn't:  its most
 important hash functions (for strings and ints) are very regular in common
 cases:
 
 >>> map(hash, (0, 1, 2, 3))
 [0, 1, 2, 3]
 >>> map(hash, ("namea", "nameb", "namec", "named"))
 [-1658398457, -1658398460, -1658398459, -1658398462]
 >>>
 
 This isn't necessarily bad!  To the contrary, in a table of size 2**i, taking
 the low-order i bits as the initial table index is extremely fast, and there
 are no collisions at all for dicts indexed by a contiguous range of ints.
 The same is approximately true when keys are "consecutive" strings.  So this
 gives better-than-random behavior in common cases, and that's very desirable.
 
 OTOH, when collisions occur, the tendency to fill contiguous slices of the
 hash table makes a good collision resolution strategy crucial.  Taking only
 the last i bits of the hash code is also vulnerable:  for example, consider
 [i << 16 for i in range(20000)] as a set of keys.  Since ints are their own
 hash codes, and this fits in a dict of size 2**15, the last 15 bits of every
 hash code are all 0:  they *all* map to the same table index.
 
 But catering to unusual cases should not slow the usual ones, so we just take
 the last i bits anyway.  It's up to collision resolution to do the rest.  If
 we *usually* find the key we're looking for on the first try (and, it turns
 out, we usually do -- the table load factor is kept under 2/3, so the odds
 are solidly in our favor), then it makes best sense to keep the initial index
 computation dirt cheap.
 
 The first half of collision resolution is to visit table indices via this
 recurrence:
 
 j = ((5*j) + 1) mod 2**i
 
 For any initial j in range(2**i), repeating that 2**i times generates each
 int in range(2**i) exactly once (see any text on random-number generation for
 proof).  By itself, this doesn't help much:  like linear probing (setting
 j += 1, or j -= 1, on each loop trip), it scans the table entries in a fixed
 order.  This would be bad, except that's not the only thing we do, and it's
 actually *good* in the common cases where hash keys are consecutive.  In an
 example that's really too small to make this entirely clear, for a table of
 size 2**3 the order of indices is:
 
 0 -> 1 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4 -> 5 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 [and here it's repeating]
 
 If two things come in at index 5, the first place we look after is index 2,
 not 6, so if another comes in at index 6 the collision at 5 didn't hurt it.
 Linear probing is deadly in this case because there the fixed probe order
 is the *same* as the order consecutive keys are likely to arrive.  But it's
 extremely unlikely hash codes will follow a 5*j+1 recurrence by accident,
 and certain that consecutive hash codes do not.
 
 The other half of the strategy is to get the other bits of the hash code
 into play.  This is done by initializing a (unsigned) vrbl "perturb" to the
 full hash code, and changing the recurrence to:
 
 j = (5*j) + 1 + perturb;
 perturb >>= PERTURB_SHIFT;
 use j % 2**i as the next table index;
 
 Now the probe sequence depends (eventually) on every bit in the hash code,
 and the pseudo-scrambling property of recurring on 5*j+1 is more valuable,
 because it quickly magnifies small differences in the bits that didn't affect
 the initial index.  Note that because perturb is unsigned, if the recurrence
 is executed often enough perturb eventually becomes and remains 0.  At that
 point (very rarely reached) the recurrence is on (just) 5*j+1 again, and
 that's certain to find an empty slot eventually (since it generates every int
 in range(2**i), and we make sure there's always at least one empty slot).
 
 Selecting a good value for PERTURB_SHIFT is a balancing act.  You want it
 small so that the high bits of the hash code continue to affect the probe
 sequence across iterations; but you want it large so that in really bad cases
 the high-order hash bits have an effect on early iterations.  5 was "the
 best" in minimizing total collisions across experiments Tim Peters ran (on
 both normal and pathological cases), but 4 and 6 weren't significantly worse.
 
 Historical:  Reimer Behrends contributed the idea of using a polynomial-based
 approach, using repeated multiplication by x in GF(2**n) where an irreducible
 polynomial for each table size was chosen such that x was a primitive root.
 Christian Tismer later extended that to use division by x instead, as an
 efficient way to get the high bits of the hash code into play.  This scheme
 also gave excellent collision statistics, but was more expensive:  two
 if-tests were required inside the loop; computing "the next" index took about
 the same number of operations but without as much potential parallelism
 (e.g., computing 5*j can go on at the same time as computing 1+perturb in the
  above, and then shifting perturb can be done while the table index is being
  masked); and the dictobject struct required a member to hold the table's
 polynomial.  In Tim's experiments the current scheme ran faster, produced
 equally good collision statistics, needed less code & used less memory.
