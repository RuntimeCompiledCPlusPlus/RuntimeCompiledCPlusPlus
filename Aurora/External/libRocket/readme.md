# libRocket - The HTML/CSS User Interface Library

http://librocket.com

libRocket is the C++ user interface package based on the HTML and CSS standards. It is 
designed as a complete solution for any project's interface needs.

libRocket uses the time-tested open standards XHTML1.0 and CSS2.0 (while borrowing features from 
HTML5 and CSS3), and extends them with features suited towards real-time applications. Because of 
this, you don't have to learn a whole new proprietary technology like other libraries in this space.

## Features

- Cross platform architecture: Windows, Mac, Linux, iPhone, etc.
- Dynamic layout system.
- Efficient application-wide styling, with a custom-built templating engine.
- Fully featured control set: buttons, sliders, drop-downs, etc.
- Runtime visual debugging suite.
- Easily integrated and extensible with Python scripting.

## Extensible
- Abstracted interfaces for plugging in to any game engine.
- Decorator engine allowing custom application-specific effects that can be applied to any element.
- Generic event system that binds seamlessly into existing projects.
